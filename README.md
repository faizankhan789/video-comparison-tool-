# video-comparison-tool-
This project is a frame-by-frame video comparison tool that uses a block-based pixel analysis algorithm to measure similarity and dissimilarity between two videos. It highlights differences with bounding boxes and displays side-by-side frames interactively via a Gradio interface, providing real-time visual and statistical feedback to users.
